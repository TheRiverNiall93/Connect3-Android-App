# Connect3-Android-App
App developed as part of 'The Complete Android Developer Course - Build 14 Apps' on Udemy

This is an app developed as part of the Udemy course 'The Complete Android Developer Course - Build 14 Apps' by Rob Percival.
This is the code for lecture 50, 'Connect 3'. It is a simple tic-tac-toe game with some (very, very!) basic images and animations.
Still trying to learn android / mobile development so feel free to offer suggestions on the code. All feedback is welcome!

Currently the app is developed according to the Nexus 4 emulator within android studio, so display may be off on other Android devices.
